[Walkthrough Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McrnJwLi_FiBboY21fiPJP1Ar-Qov-kk/view)

## Description
For this project, I was created a back end for an Ecommerce website. Using the popular Object Relation Mapper, Sequelize, I created
differene api endpoints that correspond with the normal CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. This project motivated me because I am now able to make a connect a front end with a back end that completes the full stack requirements!


## Installation

To install and try out this project, you must install the required dependencies by running 'npm init -y' then 'npm i'. Once that is done, you need to seed the database (using mySQL) and test the endpoints in Insomnia or the application of your choosing.
